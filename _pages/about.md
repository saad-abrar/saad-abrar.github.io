# Introduction
Hi, I am Saad! I am a **PhD candidate in Computer Science** at the University of Maryland, College Park, working under the supervision of [Dr. Vanessa Frias-Martinez](https://vanessafriasmartinez.umiacs.io/) in the [Urban Computing Lab](https://www.urbancomputinglab.org/).

My research is in general is situated in computational social science, drawing methodologies from machine learning, statistics, and fairness methods. I aim to improve high-stakes decision-making by leveraging behavioral data to build accurate and trustworthy predictive systems.

My dissertation focuses on "Auditing the accuracy and fairness of COVID-19 forecasting and modeling tasks with mobility and contextual data", where I develop frameworks to evaluate prediction models and mobility datasets for potential biases and performance disparities across different social determinants. Through my research, I aim to ensure that data-driven urban computing applications serve all communities equitably while maintaining high predictive performance. My research has led to **13 peer-reviewed publications** (7 journal articles, 2 conference papers, 4 workshop papers) in venues such as PLOS One, EMNLP, International Journal of Social Research Methodology, ACM SIGSPATIAL, Computers Environment and Urban Systems, ACM JCSS, EPJ Data Science.

I completed my M.S. in Computer Science from UMD (2023) and my BSc in Computer Science and Engineering from Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET) in 2017.

# Research Focus


![Research Framework](/images/ResearchFocus.png){: .full}

**Model**: I design accurate predictors that leverage contextual and behavioral signals to improve forecasting in high-stakes settings. Through systematic evaluation, I determine when and how mobility and social media data enhance predictions across public health, crime, and related domains. _[EPJ Data Science '22, JCSS '23, JMIR '23]_

**Mitigate**: I develop comprehensive audit frameworks that uncover bias and failure modes in both data and models. By separating data-driven from model-driven failures, I create targeted fairness strategies that address disparities across demographics and geographies in predictive systems. _[CEUS '23, JCSS '23, PLoS One '25, EMNLP Findings '25]_

**Measure**: I build ethically-aware data collection toolkits that empower communities to gather and analyze their own mobility and experiential data. Through participatory design that prioritizes consent and transparency, I enable equitable decision-making in public transit planning. _[COMPASS '23, IJSRM '25]_

This research aims to enable efficient and equitable data-driven policy and planning, with direct applications in:
- Public Health Response
- Urban Planning
- Economic Recovery
- Transportation Equity
