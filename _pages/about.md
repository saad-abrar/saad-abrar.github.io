# Introduction
Hi, I am Saad! I am a **PhD candidate in Computer Science** at the University of Maryland, College Park, working under the supervision of [Dr. Vanessa Frias-Martinez](https://vanessafriasmartinez.umiacs.io/)in the [Urban Computing Lab](https://www.urbancomputinglab.org/).

My research is in general is situated in computational social science, drawing methodologies from machine learning, statistics, and fairness methods. I aim to improve high-stakes decision-making by leveraging behavioral data to build accurate and trustworthy predictive systems.

My dissertation focuses on "Auditing the accuracy and fairness of COVID-19 forecasting and modeling tasks with mobility and contextual data", where I develop frameworks to evaluate prediction models and mobility datasets for potential biases and performance disparities across different social determinants. Through my research, I aim to ensure that data-driven urban computing applications serve all communities equitably while maintaining high predictive performance. My research has led to **13 peer-reviewed publications** (7 journal articles, 2 conference papers, 4 workshop papers) in venues such as PLOS One, EMNLP, International Journal of Social Research Methodology, ACM SIGSPATIAL, Computers Environment and Urban Systems, ACM JCSS, EPJ Data Science.

I completed my M.S. in Computer Science from UMD (2023) and my BSc in Computer Science and Engineering from Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET) in 2017.

# Research Focus


![Research Framework](/images/ResearchFocus.png){: .full}

My research operates at the intersection of data science, urban computing, and fairness in AI, focusing on three key areas:

**Model**: I develop tools and frameworks for collecting human mobility data, including [BALTO](https://balto.umd.edu/), a privacy-preserving toolkit ([BALTOApp](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=balto.loc.kotlin&hl=en_US) and BALTODash) for gathering multimodal (mobility + transit experiences) transit data. This work ensures representative and ethical data collection practices.

**Forecasting**: I design and implement accurate prediction models, with a particular focus on COVID-19 case forecasting and economic recovery patterns. These models integrate multiple data sources to provide reliable predictions for decision-makers.

**Auditing**: I develop frameworks to audit AI systems for fairness and evaluate the role of behavioral data in predictive modeling. This work includes assessing prediction models for demographic biases and understanding how mobility data impacts model performance across different communities.

This research aims to enable efficient and equitable data-driven policy and planning, with direct applications in:
- Public Health Response
- Urban Planning
- Economic Recovery
- Transportation Equity
