The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the importance of accurate case prediction models for public health decision-making. While studies suggest that incorporating human mobility data improves prediction accuracy, the extent and consistency of these improvements across different regions and demographic groups remain unclear. We conducted a systematic analysis using multiple mobility datasets (SafeGraph, Google, Descartes, Apple) to evaluate prediction improvements across US counties. Our results show that mobility data provides modest improvements in up to 60% of counties, with effects more pronounced for longer-term predictions. However, we identified potential biases, with lower improvements in counties with higher elderly populations and rural areas, suggesting sampling biases in mobility data collection. These findings provide critical insights for public health officials and policymakers about the value and limitations of mobility data in epidemic modeling.
