This study investigates the potential of social media data, specifically Twitter-derived vaccine attitudes, to improve COVID-19 vaccine uptake forecasting models. We developed and validated models incorporating sentiment analysis of vaccine-related tweets alongside traditional demographic and health data. Our results demonstrate that including social media-derived attitude metrics significantly improves forecast accuracy. The study provides valuable insights for public health officials and policymakers on leveraging social media data for vaccine rollout planning and communication strategies.
