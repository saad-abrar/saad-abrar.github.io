## Abstract

This extended abstract evaluates the potential of vision-language models (VLMs) to serve as accessibility bridges for process visualizations, examining their capabilities and limitations in making complex visual information accessible to diverse users.

## Key Findings

- Assessment of VLM performance on process visualization accessibility tasks
- Identification of strengths and limitations in current VLM approaches
- Implications for assistive technology development
- Recommendations for improving VLM-based accessibility tools

## Context

This work extends the ProcVQA research by specifically focusing on the accessibility implications of VLM performance on process visualizations, with applications for users with visual impairments.

## Venue

CVPR 2025 Workshop on the VizWiz Grand Challenge - focused on computer vision for accessibility

## Publication Type

Extended Abstract
