## Abstract

This paper presents a novel approach to reconstructing detailed transit itineraries from crowdsourced GPS trajectories that goes beyond traditional mode detection. The method enables more granular understanding of transit usage patterns and rider experiences.

## Key Contributions

- Development of methods to reconstruct complete transit itineraries from GPS data
- Goes beyond simple mode detection to provide leg-level transit information
- Enables analysis of detailed transit usage patterns from crowdsourced data
- Applications for transit planning and service improvement

## Context

This work builds on the BALTO project's infrastructure for ethical and sustainable mobility data collection, demonstrating practical applications of crowdsourced transit data for transportation planning.

## Venue

1st ACM SIGSPATIAL International Workshop on Spatial Intelligence for Smart and Connected Communities, 2025
