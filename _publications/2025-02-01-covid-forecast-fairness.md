## Abstract

Systematic audit of fairness and accuracy across 36 COVID-19 forecasting models from the CDC Forecast Hub, revealing persistent disparities in forecast errors across demographic groups.

## Key Findings

- Forecast errors systematically higher in counties with larger Hispanic populations and rural communities
- Deep-learning and ensemble models showed more balanced error profiles than conventional approaches  
- Need for standardized race/ethnicity fields and improved rural sampling in public health surveillance
- Pattern persists across model families: compartmental, statistical, ensemble, and deep-learning approaches
