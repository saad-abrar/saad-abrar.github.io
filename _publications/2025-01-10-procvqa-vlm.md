## Abstract

Novel benchmark exposing systematic failures of vision-language models under multi-hop reasoning and high information density in visual question answering tasks involving process mining visualizations.

## Key Findings

- Vision-language models struggle with complex process visualizations
- Performance degrades significantly with multi-hop reasoning requirements
- High information density in visualizations poses major challenges for current VLMs
- Models show systematic failure patterns across different structural properties

## Significance

This work extends the broader research agenda on auditing AI systems, moving from traditional predictive models to vision-language models in the context of process mining and data visualization.
