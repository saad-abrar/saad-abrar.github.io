# About Me

Hi, I am Saad! I am a PhD Candidate at University of Maryland at College Park working with [Dr. Vanessa Frias-Martinez](https://vanessafriasmartinez.umiacs.io/) at the [Urban Computing Lab](https://www.urbancomputinglab.org/). My research interests span across applied machine learning, human mobility, and data science for social good, specifically focusing on urban contexts. My current research focuses on auditing the fairness and accuracy of urban predictive models that use mobility and contextual data, particularly in the context of COVID-19 forecasting and economic resilience.

Previously, I completed my M.S. in Computer Science from UMD (2023) and my undergraduate studies (BSc in Computer Science and Engineering) at Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET) in 2017.

# Research Focus

My research primarily investigates three critical areas:

1. **Impact of Mobility Data on COVID-19 Predictions**: Evaluating how human mobility data affects the accuracy of COVID-19 case predictions and examining potential biases in these predictions across different demographic groups.

2. **Fairness in COVID-19 Forecasting**: Developing frameworks to audit the fairness of COVID-19 prediction models across various social determinants, with a particular focus on the CDC's Forecast Hub models.

3. **Economic Activity and Mobility Patterns**: Investigating the relationship between mobility data and economic activity, particularly focusing on small business resilience during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.
