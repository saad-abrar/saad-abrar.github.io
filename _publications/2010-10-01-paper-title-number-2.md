Deep learning approaches are increasingly being used in place-based crime prediction models, but their fairness implications remain understudied. We conducted a comprehensive audit of these models' performance across different demographic groups and neighborhood characteristics. Our analysis revealed significant disparities in prediction accuracy and error rates between different racial and socioeconomic groups. We found that these disparities persist across various deep learning architectures and temporal scales. These findings highlight the critical need for fairness considerations in the development and deployment of crime prediction models.
