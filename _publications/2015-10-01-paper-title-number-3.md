Public transit planning often lacks comprehensive data about the experiences of low-income residents, leading to inequitable service delivery. We present BALTO, a novel toolkit comprising an Android application and aggregated dashboard designed to facilitate privacy-respectful multimodal data collection from approximately 1000 low-income Baltimore City residents. The toolkit combines mobility tracking with experiential survey data, allowing for a deeper understanding of transit quality of service (QoS). Our pilot study investigates various QoS survey strategies to optimize the balance between resident participation and data quality. The BALTO toolkit represents a significant step forward in ethical and sustainable data collection for equitable transit planning.
